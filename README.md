# IR-security-system
Purpose: Detects unauthorized movement using infrared (IR) sensors and triggers an alarm or alert for security applications.
Components: Uses IR sensors, a microcontroller (Arduino, 8051, etc.), a buzzer or alarm system, and optionally a relay for automated actions.
Working: The IR sensor detects motion or obstruction, sends a signal to the microcontroller, which then activates an alarm or alert system for security notification.
